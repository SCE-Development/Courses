# Natural Language Processing Workshop

Welcome to my workshop! We'll use BERT from Google with some additional deep learning to classify Tweets as from a disaster or not.

We'll submit our solutions to the Kaggle contest [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).

1. Open the workshop Jupyter notebook [here](./nlp_workshop.ipynb)
2. Click the link in the notebook to open it in Google Colab
3. Complete the sections marked `'''TODO'''` (you'll have to reference the library documentation if you're not doing this live)
4. If you get stuck, you can look at my solution [here](./nlp_solution.ipynb)
5. Once you classify the test data set, login to Kaggle and submit your solution!
