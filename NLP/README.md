# Natural Language Processing Workshop

Welcome to my workshop! We'll use BERT from Google with some additional deep learning to classify Tweets as from a disaster or not.

We'll submit our solutions to the Kaggle contest [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/nlp-getting-started).

1. Open the workshop in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eTZXrU3ZfZNEXq0uGMs7fGznuVRC3QwB?usp=sharing)
2. Complete the sections marked `'''TODO'''` (you'll have to reference the library documentation if you're not doing this live)
3. If you get stuck, you can look at [my solution](./nlp_solution.ipynb)
4. Once you classify the test data set, login to Kaggle and submit your solution!
