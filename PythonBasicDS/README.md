# Simple_Code_Runner
This is a code runner for python, useful for competitive programming, to test your code your self
** The Runner.py may not work for mac OS or linus, I have only tested with Windows 10

## For Testing
Run the Runner.py for main code (Example Testing Q1.py for it's inputs and outputs)
1. For Main File Click "Open File" then select Solution >> Q1.py
2. For Input Directory click "Open Directory" then select input1
3. For Output Directory click "Open Directory" then select output1
4. Click on "Run!" Button to run the code
5. It should have Result "AC"

## Result
The code chosen at main file could give few result
- "AC" means it passed all inputs and gave the right output
- "WA" means it gave different output compared to the output file given
- "TLE" means it didn't finish in given Time Limit (If you give in a infinite loop, it will not finish, thus you will need to manually close the Runner.py)
- "RE" means it had runtime error

## Running your own code
- Make sure you have input files and output files ready
- The code your are going to run have to read and write to standard input and output
- Anything print on stderr will not be read


## Creating a new inputs and outputs
- Go to Generator folder and run the inputs and outputs file for the question you want!
